        <h1>Cardiac Physiology Summary</h1>

        <h2>Cardiac Function</h2>
        <p>The frog heart is a three-chambered organ, unlike the four-chambered mammalian heart, possessing a single ventricle. Its pacemaker is the sinus venosus, which receives blood from the caval veins and empties into the right atrium. The single ventricle pumps blood into the truncus arteriosus. The frog heart contains three nerve cell masses: Remake's ganglion (sinus venosus), Ludwig's ganglion (atria), and Bidder's ganglion (atrio-ventricular junction). The two vago-sympathetic nerves innervate the heart, with vagus nerve endings primarily at Remake's ganglion, supplying most of the heart except the ventricular apex, while sympathetic fibers reach all parts.</p>

        <h2>Frog's Heart Preparation</h2>
        <p>The preparation involves double pithing a frog, fastening it ventral side up, and making a longitudinal incision to expose the heart. The pericardial sac is removed, and the heart is kept moist with frog Ringer's saline. A small heart clip is inserted through the tip of the ventricle, avoiding damage, and a thread connects the ventricle to a transducer, with tension adjusted to slightly raise the recording pen above the baseline.</p>

        <h2>Assessment of Cardiac Properties</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Normal Heartbeat:</b> Record the normal cardiac rhythm at a medium to fast paper speed to distinguish atrial and ventricular contractions. Use a 1-second time marker to determine systole and diastole duration.</li>
            <li><b>Refractory Period:</b> Position the transducer to minimize atrial contraction in the recording. Stimulate the ventricle electrically with a single stimulus (20 V, 1-msec duration) at different times in the cardiac cycle.</li>
            <li><b>Tetanization:</b> Record heart contraction while stimulating it with a tetanizing frequency (10–15 stimuli/sec) at 20 V.</li>
            <li><b>Starling's Law of the Heart:</b> Adjust transducer sensitivity to a 2 cm ventricular myogram height. Stretch the ventricle by turning the tension adjuster until no further change is noted.</li>
            <li><b>Temperature Effects:</b> Record contractions at room temperature. Observe changes after applying warm (40°C) and cold (5°C) frog Ringer's saline. Rinse with room temperature Ringer's saline to normalize the beat between tests.</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="image-container">

            <p class="image-caption">Fig. (2): Record of normal heart rate and effects of temperature on it.</p>
        </div>
        <ol start="6">
            <li><b>Drug Effects:</b> Apply drugs to the sinus venosus region, observing changes in rate, contractility, or tone. Rinse with frog Ringer's saline until the heart returns to normal before applying the next drug. Drugs include Acetylcholine (0.1 mg/cc), Epinephrine (1 mg/cc), Pilocarpine (0.2 mg/cc), Nicotine (1 mg/cc), and Atropine (1 mg/cc). After Atropine, reapply Acetylcholine and compare responses.</li>
        </ol>

        </div>
        <ol start="7">
            <li><b>Heart Block:</b> Tie a loose ligature at the atria-ventricle junction. Gradually tighten it, observing changes in atrial and ventricular rhythm:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>First-degree block:</b> Prolonged interval between atrial and ventricular contraction.</li>
                    <li><b>Second-degree block:</b> Some impulses fail to reach the ventricle, altering the atrial-to-ventricular beat ratio.</li>
                    <li><b>Third-degree block:</b> Impulses fail to pass the AV node and His bundle; the ventricle may start an independent rhythm or only atria contract. Release the ligature to see if normal AV beat is restored.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        </div>
        <ol start="8">
            <li><b>All-or-None Law:</b> Increase pressure on the AV ligature until the ventricle is quiet. Stimulate the ventricle with electrodes to determine threshold stimulus and record contraction height. Stimulate with increasing voltages (single stimuli) and record contraction height at each voltage.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Cardiac Extrasystole</h2>
        <p>Extrasystole is a premature beat from an ectopic focus during the relative refractory period (R.R.P.) of the preceding normal heartbeat, followed by a compensatory pause. During this pause, the normal cardiac impulse originates from the SA node. Stimulation during an extrasystole causes no response as the heart is in its absolute refractory period (A.R.P.). Causes include an ectopic focus outside the cardiac pacemaker. Types include atrial, A.V. nodal, and ventricular extrasystoles. The compensatory pause occurs when the normal SA node impulse reaches the ventricle during the extrasystole's A.R.P. The duration of an extrasystole plus the preceding beat and compensatory pause equals two normal beats.</p>

        <h3>Study Questions (Cardiac Function)</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Normal frog's Heart rate:</b> <span class="answer">Varies, typically 30-60 beats/min at room temp (not explicitly stated in text but common knowledge for frog heart experiments).</span></li>
            <li><b>Duration of systole:</b> <span class="answer">[Value from actual ECG recording] sec</span> <b>Duration of diastole:</b> <span class="answer">[Value from actual ECG recording] sec</span></li>
            <li><b>What causes the delay between atrial and ventricular systoles?</b> <span class="answer">The delay is caused by the slow conduction of the electrical impulse through the atrioventricular (AV) node, allowing time for the atria to contract and fill the ventricles before ventricular contraction.</span></li>
            <li><b>How does the ligature produce a heart block in the frog heart?</b> <span class="answer">The ligature compresses the atrioventricular junction, interfering with the conduction of electrical impulses from the atria to the ventricles. Tightening the ligature progressively can lead to first, second, or third-degree heart block by delaying or completely blocking impulse transmission.</span></li>
            <li><b>How does the structure of the heart make the all-or-none law possible?</b> <span class="answer">The all-or-none law is possible because cardiac muscle cells are interconnected by gap junctions within intercalated discs, forming a functional syncytium. Once a threshold stimulus is reached in any part of this syncytium, the action potential rapidly spreads throughout the entire muscle, causing a full contraction of the stimulated chamber.</span></li>
            <li><b>In the following questions, fill in the blanks with the appropriate word:</b>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Venous return enters the <span class="answer">right</span> atrium before passing into the <span class="answer">ventricle</span>. During systole, the blood in the ventricle does not flow back into the atrium because of the <span class="answer">valves</span>.</li>
                    <li>Influx of <span class="answer">Ca²⁺</span> as well as the reduced efflux of <span class="answer">K⁺</span> during the depolarization of cardiac myocytes results in the <span class="answer">long</span> duration of this depolarization, making the cardiac action potential different from the skeletal action potential.</li>
                    <li>The <span class="answer">sinoatrial (SA)</span> and <span class="answer">atrioventricular (AV)</span> node cells are different from other cardiac myocytes in that their RMP is <span class="answer">less negative</span> and changes spontaneously.</li>
                    <li>The ventricle fills with blood from the atrium during <span class="answer">diastole</span> and ejects blood into the aorta during <span class="answer">systole</span>.</li>
                    <li>A heart attack occurs because a <span class="answer">coronary</span> artery is blocked, cutting off oxygen supply to the <span class="answer">myocardium (heart muscle)</span>.</li>
                    <li>A cardiac action potential travels between cardiac myocytes via <span class="answer">gap</span> junctions. These junctions are found in regions where cardiac muscle cells join called <span class="answer">intercalated discs</span>.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><b>Briefly describe how activity in the SA node ensures rhythmic contraction of the heart.</b> <span class="answer">The sinoatrial (SA) node acts as the primary pacemaker of the heart because its cells have the fastest intrinsic rate of spontaneous depolarization. This rhythmic depolarization generates electrical impulses that spread rapidly through the atria, causing them to contract. The impulse then reaches the AV node and subsequently the ventricles, ensuring a coordinated and rhythmic contraction of the entire heart.</span></li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Electrocardiogram (ECG)</h2>
        <p>The ECG records the heart's electrical activity from the body surface. The machine is an electrocardiograph. There are nine standard recording points: three limb points (VL, VR, VF) and six chest points (V1-V6). An ECG requires two electrodes: a reference and an active one, forming a "lead".</p>
        <p>The central (Wilson's) electrode connects the three limb extremities (left arm, right arm, left leg) and has zero potential, serving as a reference in unipolar leads.</p>

        <h3>Types of ECG Leads:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Unipolar Chest (Precordial) Leads:</b> Reference electrode at zero potential (Wilson's electrode), active electrode on V1-V6 points.
                <ul>
                    <li>V1: Right border of sternum, 4th intercostal space.</li>
                    <li>V2: Left border of sternum, 4th intercostal space.</li>
                    <li>V3: Midway on line joining V2 and V4.</li>
                    <li>V4: Left midclavicular line, 5th intercostal space.</li>
                    <li>V5: Left anterior axillary line, same horizontal line as V4 and V5.</li>
                    <li>V6: Left midaxillary line, same horizontal line as V4 and V5.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Standard Bipolar Leads:</b> Connects any two of right arm, left arm, and left leg.
                <ul>
                    <li>Lead I: Left arm (active) – Right arm (reference).</li>
                    <li>Lead II: Left leg (active) – Right arm (reference).</li>
                    <li>Lead III: Left leg (active) – Left arm (reference).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Augmented Limb Leads (aVL, aVR, aVF):</b> Active electrode on one limb, reference electrode from the other two limb points. Amplitude is magnified 1.5 times compared to unipolar limb leads.</li>

            </li>
            <li><b>How would the electrical axis change during pregnancy? Why?</b> <span class="answer">During pregnancy, the electrical axis of the heart typically shifts to the left. This is due to the elevation of the diaphragm by the growing uterus, which pushes the heart upward and rotates it slightly to the left.</span></li>
            <li><b>A 60-year-old woman is seen in the emergency room because of the sudden onset of fluttering in the chest an hour earlier. In addition, she has experienced weakness and faintness during this time. Physical examination reveals a regular cardiac rhythm and rate of 150 beats/min, and a blood pressure of 80/60 mmHg. Massage of the carotid sinus resulted in a sudden decrease of the heart rate to 90 beats/min and an increase of blood pressure to 110/70 mm Hg. The ECG obtained before carotid sinus massage is depicted in the following figure:</b></li>

        <ol type="a">
            <li><b>What is the significance of the regular appearance of the P wave before the QRS complex in this patient? What is the pacemaker area for the normal heart?</b> <span class="answer">The regular appearance of a P wave before each QRS complex indicates that the pacemaker is in the atria. The sinoatrial (SA) node is the normal pacemaker. In paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, as suggested by the symptoms and response to carotid sinus massage, the pacemaker is located in an ectopic focus somewhere in the atria.</span></li>
            <li><b>What is the patient's pulse pressure? Give a reasonable approximation of the mean arterial pressure? What is the best explanation of her small pulse pressure and low mean arterial pressure (MAP)?</b> <span class="answer">Pulse pressure = Systolic BP - Diastolic BP = 80 mmHg - 60 mmHg = 20 mmHg. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) = Diastolic BP + 1/3 Pulse Pressure = 60 mmHg + (1/3) * 20 mmHg = 60 + 6.67 ≈ 67 mmHg. The low pulse pressure and low MAP are likely due to decreased stroke volume resulting from the reduced time for ventricular filling at the high heart rate (150 bpm). If stroke volume decreases disproportionately, cardiac output (CO = stroke volume × heart rate) will fall, leading to a decrease in MAP (MAP = Total Peripheral Resistance × CO).</span></li>
            <li><b>Why did massage of the carotid sinus lower the heart rate and raise blood pressure?</b> <span class="answer">Massage of the carotid sinus stimulates stretch receptors, which increases parasympathetic activity and decreases sympathetic activity from the vasomotor center impinging on the atrial pacemaker. This slows the sinoatrial node's pacemaker activity. The slower heart rate allows for more diastolic filling time, increasing stroke volume and cardiac output, which in turn leads to an increased MAP.</span></li>
            <li><b>What was the cause of the weakness and fainting?</b> <span class="answer">The decreased mean arterial pressure (MAP) resulted in reduced cerebral blood flow and oxygen utilization in the brain, causing symptoms ranging from weakness and fainting (syncope).</span></li>
            <li><b>How does stimulation of parasympathetic fibers and decreased activity of sympathetic fibers stop the tachycardia?</b> <span class="answer">Increased acetylcholine release from parasympathetic fibers and decreased norepinephrine from sympathetic fibers combine to reduce the rate of rise of pacemaker potentials. This causes the ectopic pacemaker focus to slow its rate below that of the sinoatrial node, allowing the normal SA node rhythm to resume.</span></li>

        <h2>Arterial Pulsations</h2>
        <p>Arterial pulsations, felt as "pressure points," provide insights into cardiovascular status. Common palpation sites include the radial artery, carotid, femoral, popliteal, and dorsalis pedis arteries.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Basal Pulse Rate:</b> Slowest pulse in a resting supine position, taken as three 1-minute counts with 1-minute intervals.</li>
            <li><b>Pulse Deficit:</b> Difference between arterial pulsations and ventricular beats at the chest wall.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Pulse Qualities to Observe:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Frequency:</b> Normal (60-90 beats/min), rapid (>90 beats/min, tachycardia), or slow (<60 beats/min, bradycardia).</li>
            <li><b>Rhythm:</b> Regular, regular irregularity (e.g., 2nd-degree heart block, respiratory sinus arrhythmia), or irregular irregularity (e.g., extrasystoles, atrial fibrillation). Atrial vs. ventricular extrasystoles can be differentiated by palpation.</li>
            <li><b>Amplitude (Weak or strong):</b> Depends on pulse pressure and stroke volume. High pulse pressure leads to strong pulsations, e.g., water hammer pulse in aortic valve incompetence.</li>
            <li><b>Tension (Hard or soft):</b> Estimates systolic pressure by digital pressure needed to occlude the pulse wave.</li>
            <li><b>Symmetry (Equal or unequal):</b> Absent or weak pulse unilaterally suggests arterial stenosis or obstruction.</li>
            <li><b>State of the wall:</b> Healthy arteries are not palpable.</li>
            <li><b>Effect of changing posture:</b> Compare pulse rate lying down vs. standing for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li><b>Effect of exercise:</b> After resting rate, step up/down on a stool for 1 minute, then record pulse every minute until resting level is reached, noting recovery time.</li>
            <li><b>Valsalva Maneuver:</b> Record pulse for 10 seconds, then have subject inhale deeply, hold breath, and exert abdominal pressure while continuing to record. Compare heart rate before inhalation vs. before exhalation.</li>

        <h3>Arterial Pulse Curve (Sphygmogram)</h3>
        <p>Recorded by a sphygmograph, the sphygmogram shows arterial expansion during each cardiac cycle.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Ascending limb (anacrotic limb):</b> Rise in ABP to systolic pressure (e.g., 120 mmHg) due to blood ejection into the aorta during left ventricular systole.</li>
            <li><b>Descending limb (catacrotic limb):</b> Fall in ABP to diastolic pressure (e.g., 80 mmHg) due to blood flow to tissues during left ventricular diastole.</li>
            <li><b>Dicrotic notch and wave:</b> Not normally palpable, seen in sphygmogram. Occurs due to blood vibration in the aorta as aortic pressure decreases during protodiastolic phase, followed by an increase as aortic valve closes, causing oscillation transmitted to peripheral artery.</li>

This reduces venous return to the heart, which in turn decreases end-diastolic volume, stroke volume, and cardiac output. The resulting drop in mean arterial pressure (MAP) reduces cerebral blood flow, leading to insufficient oxygen supply to the brain and causing symptoms like weakness and fainting (syncope).</span></li>

        <h3>Study Questions (Vascular Reactions)</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Explain the physiological mechanisms operating in the cold pressor test. Why would the systolic pressure rise only 10 mmHg in a normotensive individual?</b> <span class="answer">The cold pressor test involves immersing a limb in cold water, which causes a systemic vasoconstriction primarily mediated by the sympathetic nervous system. This widespread vasoconstriction increases total peripheral resistance, leading to a rise in arterial blood pressure, particularly systolic pressure. In a normotensive individual, the regulatory mechanisms of the cardiovascular system are efficient. A rise of only 10 mmHg in systolic pressure indicates a normal compensatory response to maintain blood pressure within a healthy range, preventing excessive hypertension. This minimal increase is a result of a balanced autonomic response to the cold stimulus.</span></li>
            <li><b>Describe the relationship between the venous return, the pumping capacity of the heart, and the cardiac output.</b> <span class="answer">Venous return, the pumping capacity of the heart, and cardiac output (CO) are intimately related. Cardiac output (CO = Heart Rate × Stroke Volume) is the volume of blood pumped by the heart per minute. According to the Frank-Starling mechanism, the pumping capacity of the heart (specifically, stroke volume) is directly proportional to the venous return. An increase in venous return stretches the cardiac muscle fibers more, leading to a stronger contraction and thus a larger stroke volume, which in turn increases cardiac output. Conversely, a decrease in venous return reduces stroke volume and cardiac output. Therefore, venous return is a primary determinant of the heart's pumping capacity and, consequently, cardiac output.</span></li>
            <li><b>What are the factors which help venous return of blood to the heart?</b> <span class="answer">Several factors aid the venous return of blood to the heart:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Skeletal Muscle Pump:</b> Contraction of skeletal muscles, especially in the legs, compresses veins, pushing blood towards the heart. Venous valves prevent backflow.</li>
                    <li><b>Respiratory Pump:</b> During inspiration, diaphragmatic descent increases abdominal pressure and decreases thoracic pressure, creating a pressure gradient that draws blood from abdominal veins into the thoracic veins and heart.</li>
                    <li><b>Sympathetic Venoconstriction:</b> Sympathetic stimulation causes constriction of veins, which reduces their capacity and pushes more blood back to the heart.</li>
                    <li><b>Cardiac Suction (Ventricular Diastole):</b> During ventricular diastole, as the ventricles relax, a negative pressure is created that helps to pull blood from the atria and great veins into the heart.</li>
                    <li><b>Residual Pressure from Arterial System:</b> The pressure remaining from arterial pulsations helps to propel blood through the capillaries and into the venous system.</li>
                    <li><b>Gravity (in certain positions):</b> When the body is in a position where veins are above the heart (e.g., lying down with feet elevated), gravity assists venous return.</li>
                </ul>
            </span></li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Auscultation of Heart Sounds</h2>
        <p>Four heart sounds are produced with each heartbeat. First (S1) and second (S2) sounds are always audible. The third sound (S3) is heard with rapid circulation (e.g., exercise, young children). The fourth sound (S4) is normally inaudible, heard in pathological conditions (e.g., atrial hypertrophy).</p>
        <p>Heart sounds can be heard by immediate (direct ear application) or mediate (stethoscope) auscultation. Modern stethoscopes are binaural, with metal ear tubes ending in soft plastic tips directed medially and slightly forward.</p>
        <p>The stethoscope's chest piece has a diaphragm (for low-pitched sounds like S1, S2, systolic murmurs) and a bell (for very low-pitched sounds like S3, S4, diastolic murmurs). The bell should be applied gently; pressing too hard makes the skin act as a diaphragm.</p>
        <div class="image-container">

            <p class="image-caption">Fig. (23): Stethoscope.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Connecting tubes are rubber or synthetic, 30-35 cm long. S1 and S2 are heard anywhere on the chest. Special attention is given to four major auscultation areas:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Mitral area (M):</b> Cardiac apex, 5th left intercostal space, midclavicular line (below nipple in males).</li>
            <li><b>Tricuspid area (T):</b> Left 4th intercostal space near sternum.</li>
            <li><b>Aortic area (A):</b> Second right intercostal space near sternum.</li>
            <li><b>Pulmonary area (P):</b> Second left intercostal space near sternum.</li>
        </ul>

        </div>
        <p>Clinically, heart sounds are heard in sequence. Focus on loudness and character. Note relation between heart sounds and cardiac cycle events. Identify any murmurs (systolic or diastolic):</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Systolic murmurs:</b> Occur during ventricular systole, between S1 and S2.</li>
            <li><b>Diastolic murmurs:</b> Occur during ventricular diastole, between S2 and the next S1.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Study Questions (Auscultation)</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Why the first and second heart sounds are different in intensity or pitch?</b> <span class="answer">The first heart sound (S1) is caused by the closure of the atrioventricular (mitral and tricuspid) valves at the beginning of ventricular systole. It is typically described as a "lubb" sound, is generally longer in duration, and lower in pitch. The second heart sound (S2) is caused by the closure of the semilunar (aortic and pulmonary) valves at the end of ventricular systole. It is described as a "dupp" sound, is shorter, sharper, and higher in pitch. These differences in intensity and pitch are due to the distinct valve structures involved, the pressures at which they close, and the tension of the chordae tendineae and ventricular walls.</span></li>
            <li><b>What is a heart murmur? What causes it?</b> <span class="answer">A heart murmur is an abnormal sound heard during the cardiac cycle, typically described as a "swishing" or "whooshing" sound, caused by turbulent blood flow through the heart valves or major blood vessels. Murmurs can be caused by:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Stenosis:</b> Narrowing of a heart valve, impeding forward blood flow.</li>
                    <li><b>Insufficiency/Regurgitation:</b> Incompetent (leaky) heart valves that allow blood to flow backward when they should be closed.</li>
                    <li><b>Increased blood flow:</b> High cardiac output, which can increase the velocity of blood flow through normal valves.</li>
                    <li><b>Structural defects:</b> Abnormal openings between heart chambers (e.g., septal defects) or abnormal blood vessel connections.</li>
